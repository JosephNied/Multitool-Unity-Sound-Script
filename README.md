# Multitool-Unity-Sound-Script
A Unity package containing a script that allows you to implement many types of complex sounds in Unity quickly and efficiently. Examples include playing sounds from a list, playing random sounds (with or without repetition), fading sounds in and out, looping sounds, and allowing you to route sounds into the mixer all without worrying about creating audio sources.
